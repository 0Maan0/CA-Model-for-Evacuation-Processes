# CA-Model-for-Evacuation-Processes
CA Model for Evacuation Processes for the course Complex System Simulation

FFCA_wrap contains the main simulation function
to run the simulation to determine the ciritcal density at which congestion happens: run run_simulation.py
metrics.py contains the functions to plot and compute the flux, order parameer and congetsion rate.
Vizualitation.py contains the function use to create a gif of the simulation process.
